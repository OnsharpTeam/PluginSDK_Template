# PluginSDK Template
This is a template repository for creating Onset Plugins with the PluginSDK.

This template is created for Developers which uses CMake as their choice for Building.

It does not contain any Solution so using this with Visual Studio is possible but not directly intended. We suggest CLion by Jetbrains

Use the **Setup.py** to automatically rename all required files to whatever your Project should be. Obviously, Python is required. Run the Script via CMD (*python Setup.py*)
